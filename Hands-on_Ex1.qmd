## Overview

In this hands-on exercise, we will handle geospatial data in R by using **sf** package.

## Getting Started

Below are the two R packages that will be used:

```{r}
packages = c('sf', 'tidyverse')
for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}
```

hahahaha
