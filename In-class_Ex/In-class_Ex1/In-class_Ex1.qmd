## Overview

In this in-class exercise, I will learn to compute spatial weights using R.

## Installing & Loading R Packages

The code chunk below installs and loads tidyverse and sf packages into R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)
```

## Import Geospatial Data

### Import polygon features

This code chunk will import ESRI shapefile into R.

(Since data file is in the Hands-on Exercise folder, we retrieve the data from the root this time.)

```{r}
mpsz = st_read(dsn = "C:/Jacobche/ISSS624/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex1/data/geospatial", 
               layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```

### Import and transform into projected coordinates system

```{r}
preschool = st_read("C:/Jacobche/ISSS624/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex1/data/geospatial/pre-schools-location-kml.kml") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```
