## Overview

In this hands-on exercise, we will learn to delineate homogeneous region by using geographically referenced multivariate data. There are two major analysis:

-   hierarchical cluster analysis

-   spatially constrained cluster analysis

By the end of this exercise, we will able:

-   to convert GIS polygon data into R's simple feature data.frame by using appropriate functions of **sf** package of R

-   to convert simple feature data.frame into R's SpatialPolygonDataFrame object by using appropriate **sf** of package of R

-   to perform custer analysis by using *hclust()* of Base R

-   to perform spatially constrained cluster analysis using *skater()* of Base R

-   to visualise the analysis output by using **ggplot2** and **tmap** package
